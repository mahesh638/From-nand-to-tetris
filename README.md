# From-nand-to-tetris
Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris is a project based online course in Coursera from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The motive is to build a working computer in a bottom up process. 
<br/> <br/>
The process starts with a Nand gate. The first part of the course focuses on building the hardware component of the project. This includes creating memory, ALU, Assembler etc.
<br/><br/>
The second part of the course involves creating an operating system, output and input devices to control the machine.
<br/><br/>
Nand-to-Tetris Report.pdf provides a detailed description of the work done. The project files are added corresponding to the weekly assignment submissions in the Nand2Tetris course on Coursera.
